## Kwizz

This project is a web application designed to host general knowledge quizzes. The backend is built using Golang with the [Fiber framework](https://docs.gofiber.io/), while the frontend is developed using HTML and CSS. The application allows users to participate in quizzes, test their knowledge, and view results in an interactive and engaging manner.

The project is still a work in progress.
